2018-??-?? 0.10.0a
  Breaking changes:
    * Filter values with a space at the start or end must now be enclosed by
      single or double quotes (see `help filter`).
    * The short option '-ca' for the 'tab' command was renamed to '-C'.
    * In peer lists, the 'ip' column, filter and sorter was renamed to 'host'.

  Other changes:
    * The TUI commands 'interactive' and 'command' let the user edit a
      predefined command interactively before executing it.
    * The TUI command 'limit' applies a second filter to any list.
    * The TUI command 'find' highlights and jumps to a search phrase (currently
      only help texts are supported).
    * The command 'rename' allows renaming torrents and files or directories
      within a torrent.
    * New default torrentlist/filelist/etc keybinding </> lets you quickly
      reduce a long list by typing a filter expression.
    * New default helptext keybindings </>, <n> and <N> add support for
      'less'-style(-ish) highlighting and searching in help texts.
    * New default keybinding <t m> interactively asks you where to move a
      torrent.
    * New default key bindings <t n> in torrent lists and <n> in file lists
      rename torrents, files and directories interactively.
    * New 'remove' option --force removes an unlimited number of torrents
      without confirmation.
    * New setting 'remove.max-hits' can be set to negative number to never ask
      for confirmation when removing torrents.
    * All time-based filters now accept relative time deltas (e.g. "1h30m") and
      absolute time stamps (e.g. "2018-07-05").  Their behaviour has also
      changed slightly (see `help filters`).
    * The completed time of a torrent now defaults to the time it was added if
      it was never downloaded (e.g. if you're the original uploader).
    * The default filter in peer lists is now 'host'.
    * 'comment' was added as a torrent filter.

  Fixed bugs:
    * No longer crash with a KeyError when listing peers with an unknown country
      code.
    * In yes/no prompts, default to 'no' in non-interactive mode (when stdout is
      not a TTY).
    * Using a boolean filter as a comparative filter (e.g. 'downloading = asdf')
      now results in an error.
    * Fix rare crash in peer lists: "TypeError: __str__ returned non-string
      (type NoneType)"


2018-05-07 0.9.0a
  Changed dependencies:
    * The legacy GeoIP module has been replaced by maxminddb
      https://pypi.org/project/maxminddb/

  Breaking changes:
    * The names and aliases of columns, filters and sorters have been changed
      again (sorry) to make them more consistent and easier to guess (e.g. the
      column 'rate-limit-up' is now called 'limit-rate-up' like the setting
      'srv.limit.rate.up' and '%dn' is now a filter, sorter and column in all
      lists (if applicable))
    * The setting 'srv.url' was replaced by the new settings 'connect.host',
      'connect.port', 'connect.path', 'connect.user', 'connect.password' and
      'connect.tls' (Thanks to David Blajda for adding 'connect.path')
    * The setting 'srv.autostart-torrents' was renamed to 'srv.autostart'
    * The history for the built-in command line is now stored in
      ~/.local/share/stig/history by default (Thanks to Paulo Marcel Coelho
      Aragão)

  Other changes:
    * The 'set' command now shows a list of settings when called without
      argments
    * The value of a setting can now come from shell command,
      e.g. `set connect.password:eval pass transmission`
    * Setting any list with a limited number of options to "*" sets it to all
      options (e.g. `set columns.torrents '*'`).  This also works for --columns
      and --sort arguments options (e.g. `lsp -c '*'`).
    * New setting 'geoip' enables/disables country code lookups for peer lists
    * New setting 'geoip.dir' specifies where the geolocation database is cached
    * In peer lists, peers' host names are displayed instead of their IPs (may
      be slow; disable with 'set reverse-dns false')
    * Process name in tmux sessions is set to 'stig' if setproctitle module is
      installed (Thanks to Kutsan Kaplan and Nicholas Marriott)
    * 'ratelimit' command now prints the new limit by default for global and
      per-torrent rates unless the --quiet option is given
    * Added torrent list column: 'id'
    * When listing files in the CLI, the 'name' column now contains the absolute
      path to each file if stdout is not a TTY

      'enabled'/'disabled'

    * In torrent details, the 'Completed' date was displayed as the unix epoch
      (1970-01-01 ...) if unknown, and the 'Ratio' was displayed as negative

    * Don't throw 'Unclosed client session' errors when opening multiple
      torrent lists at once while not being connected to the daemon
