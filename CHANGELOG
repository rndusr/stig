2021-08-10 0.12.2a0
  Other changes:
    * "unbind --all t" now unbinds "t" in all keybinding contexts.

  Fixed bugs:
    * Removed tilde expansion from completion candidates for the :move command


2021-02-09 0.12.1a0
  Fixed bugs:
    * Fix "Unclosed client session" error when not using the TUI


2021-02-07 0.12.0a0
  Other changes:
    * New "connect.proxy" setting that specifies a SOCKS tunnel for RPC
      communication.
    * Move cursor to the end of command when moving through history in the
      builtin CLI.

      working again.
    * Fix "RuntimeError: Event loop stopped before Future completed." when
      exiting the TUI.


2020-07-04 0.11.2a0
  Fixed bugs:
    * Include user and password in "connect.url" setting.  This fixes a bug where the
      password is not stored properly when dumping settings.


2020-06-20 0.11.1a0
  Fixed bugs:
    * Fix help for remote settings, e.g. "help srv.path.incomplete".
    * Possibly fixed a race condition that resulted in new torrent lists being empty until
      the next poll iteration.


2020-06-05 0.11.0a
  Breaking changes:
    * The 'scrollbar' palette in themes was removed and the following palettes were added:
           torrentlist.scrollbar
           filelist.scrollbar
           peerlist.scrollbar
           trackerlist.scrollbar
           settinglist.scrollbar
           log.scrollbar
           helptext.scrollbar
     * Some redundant torrent filters were removed:
       - "incomplete" is the same as "!complete"
       - "public" is the same as "!private"
     * The "summary" command was renamed to "details".
     * When renaming files, the "rename" command now attempts to rename files in all
       matching torrents.  When renaming torrents or if the new --unique option is given,
       the torrent filter expression must match exactly one torrent or nothing is renamed.
       This also works when renaming the focused file or directory in file lists in the
       TUI.
     * Renaming a torrent to an existing file/directory is now possible.
     * GeoIP support was dropped[1] and the peer list filter, column and sorter "country"
       as well as the settings "geoip" and "geoip.dir" were removed. If you use a custom
       theme, you also need to remove the "country" parts from it.
     * Some default keybindings for sorting lists have changed.

  Other changes:
    * Press <tab> in the built-in CLI to complete commands and arguments.
    * Move tabs with <H> and <L>.
    * Display free space in the bottom bar.
    * The command 'dump' collects settings, keybindings and open tabs, translates them
      into commands and writes them to a file or stdout.  It is bound to <alt-S> by
      default.
    * Filters can use regular expressions with the new '=~' operator.
    * The command 'magnet' creates magnet URIs for torrents.
    * The help structure was changed so that lists of commands/filters/settings and
      manuals explaining the concepts are separate.
    * Added "hash" filter to find torrents by info hash.
    * Peer download rate estimates are now always calculated, not just when a peer list is
      focused.
    * New 'connect.url' setting allows you to set host, port, etc with a single command.
    * The 'sort' command's --delete argument removes sort orders from the current list.

  Fixed bugs:
    * File filters caused a crash when applied to single-file torrents.
    * Fixed crash with "Filter can't end with operator".
    * Download priority in TUI file lists is now updated correctly.
    * Parameters for any command's --sort option didn't accept aliases.
    * Setting filters are now documented (`help filters`).
    * When 'remove.max-hits' triggered, the displayed list of torrents didn't handle
      spaces correctly.

2018-09-25 0.10.1a
  Fixed bugs:
    * For torrents with exactly one directory that contains exactly one file,
      listing its files in the TUI resulted in a crash: KeyError: 'is-wanted'


2018-09-07 0.10.0a
  Breaking changes:
    * The 'tui.cli.history-file' setting was removed (see 'tui.cli.history-dir'
      below)
    * Filter values with a space at the start or end must now be enclosed by
      single or double quotes (see `help filter`).
    * The short option '-ca' for the 'tab' command was renamed to '-C'.
    * In peer lists, the 'ip' column, filter and sorter was renamed to 'host'.

  Other changes:
    * The TUI command 'interactive' lets the user edit a predefined command
      interactively before executing it.
    * The TUI command 'setcommand' opens and pre-fills the command line with any
      string.
    * The TUI command 'limit' applies a second filter to any list.
    * The TUI command 'find' highlights and jumps to a search phrase (currently
      only help texts are supported).
    * The command 'rename' allows renaming torrents and files or directories
      within a torrent.
    * Keybindings can now have descriptions which are displayed in the output of
      `help keymap` and when completing key chains.
    * New default torrentlist/filelist/etc keybinding </> quickly reduces long
      lists.
    * New default helptext keybindings </>, <n> and <N> add support for
      'less'-style(-ish) highlighting and searching in help texts.
    * New default keybindings <t n> in torrent lists and <f n> in file lists
      rename torrents, files and directories interactively.
    * New default keybinding <t m> asks you where to move a torrent.
    * New 'remove' option --force removes an unlimited number of torrents
      without confirmation.
    * New setting 'remove.max-hits' can be set to a negative number to never ask
      for confirmation when removing torrents.
    * New setting 'tui.cli.history-dir' specifies a directory instead of a file,
      which allows having a history for each interactive command (i.e. when
      pressing </> you can recall previous inputs with <ctrl-p> and <ctrl-n>
      like in 'less').
      The old history file is automatically moved to its new location
      <tui.cli.history-dir>/commands.
    * All time-based filters now accept relative time deltas (e.g. "1h30m") and
      absolute time stamps (e.g. "2018-07-05").  Their behaviour has also
      changed slightly (see `help filters`).
    * The completed time of a torrent now defaults to the time it was added if
      it was never downloaded (e.g. if you're the original uploader).
    * The default filter in peer lists is now 'host'.
    * 'comment' was added as a torrent filter.
    * 'ratelimit' command displays current limits if no new limit is given.

  Fixed bugs:
    * No longer crash with a KeyError when listing peers with an unknown country
      code.
    * In yes/no prompts, default to 'no' in non-interactive mode (when stdout is
      not a TTY).
    * Using a boolean filter as a comparative filter (e.g. 'downloading = asdf')
      now results in an error.
    * Fix rare crash in peer lists: "TypeError: __str__ returned non-string
      (type NoneType)"


2018-05-07 0.9.0a
  Changed dependencies:
    * The legacy GeoIP module has been replaced by maxminddb
      https://pypi.org/project/maxminddb/

  Breaking changes:
    * The names and aliases of columns, filters and sorters have been changed
      again (sorry) to make them more consistent and easier to guess (e.g. the
      column 'rate-limit-up' is now called 'limit-rate-up' like the setting
      'srv.limit.rate.up' and '%dn' is now a filter, sorter and column in all
      lists (if applicable))
    * The setting 'srv.url' was replaced by the new settings 'connect.host',
      'connect.port', 'connect.path', 'connect.user', 'connect.password' and
      'connect.tls' (Thanks to David Blajda for adding 'connect.path')
    * The setting 'srv.autostart-torrents' was renamed to 'srv.autostart'
    * The history for the built-in command line is now stored in
      ~/.local/share/stig/history by default (Thanks to Paulo Marcel Coelho
      Arag√£o)

  Other changes:
    * The 'set' command now shows a list of settings when called without
      argments
    * The value of a setting can now come from shell command,
      e.g. `set connect.password:eval pass transmission`
    * Setting any list with a limited number of options to "*" sets it to all
      options (e.g. `set columns.torrents '*'`).  This also works for --columns
      and --sort arguments options (e.g. `lsp -c '*'`).
    * New setting 'geoip' enables/disables country code lookups for peer lists
    * New setting 'geoip.dir' specifies where the geolocation database is cached
    * In peer lists, peers' host names are displayed instead of their IPs (may
      be slow; disable with 'set reverse-dns false')
    * Process name in tmux sessions is set to 'stig' if setproctitle module is
      installed (Thanks to Kutsan Kaplan and Nicholas Marriott)
    * 'ratelimit' command now prints the new limit by default for global and
      per-torrent rates unless the --quiet option is given
    * Added torrent list column: 'id'
    * When listing files in the CLI, the 'name' column now contains the absolute
      path to each file if stdout is not a TTY

  Fixed bugs:
    * Mitigate high CPU load for urwid 2.x and later
    * Invalid tracker URLs (e.g. with port -1) don't cause crash anymore
    * Catch SIGINT (<ctrl-c>) in CLI mode
    * The values of the settings 'connect.port' and 'srv.port' are now properly
      displayed in 'help' output

  Breaking changes:
    * Some filters, sorters and columns have been renamed for consistency
    * The file priority 'shun' is now called 'off'
    * The 'details' command has been renamed to 'summary' ('details' still works
      as an alias)

      <t+P> to <t+s> and <t+S> (so we can open the peer list with <t+p>)
    * For boolean settings, the values 'enable'/'disable' have been replaced by
      'enabled'/'disabled'
    * The 'clearlog' command has been removed (see new 'log' command)

      the settings 'srv.limit.rate.up/down'

  Other changes:
    * New commands: 'trackerlist', 'tracker add|remove'
    * New contexts for keybindings: trackerlist, tracker
    * New command 'log' can clear the log, scroll up/down and append info/error
      messages to it
    * New server settings: srv.utp, srv.dht, srv.pex, srv.lpd, srv.port,

    * Foreground colors in the tab bar are now all bright in the default theme
    * Time deltas now show seconds if less than two minutes away
    * Use pyxdg module instead of appdirs (if you installed with pip, run
      `pip3 uninstall --yes xdg`)

  Fixed bugs:
    * Long torrent lists in narrow terminals no longer take ages to print
    * In torrent details, the 'Completed' date was displayed as the unix epoch
      (1970-01-01 ...) if unknown, and the 'Ratio' was displayed as negative

    * New 'unbind' command option --all removes all keybindings
    * New 'add' command option --path downloads to a custom path
    * New log messages are now automatically hidden after showing them for 10

    * 'tui' command can hide/show/toggle multiple elements, as documented
    * Keybinding context 'file' was not documented in help for 'bind' command
