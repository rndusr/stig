* stig
  stig is a TUI (text user interface) and CLI (command line interface) client
  for the [[http://www.transmissionbt.com/][BitTorrent Client Transmission]] (and perhaps others in the future).

  [[file:https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rndusr/stig/master/screenshot.png]]

** Features
   - Use *filters* to list/start/stop/remove/... torrents matching any
     combination of criteria
   - *Tabs* with different lists, documentation, etc
   - Everything is done via *commands*, and they are invoked
     - through *chained keybindings*,
     - by entering them in a *built-in command prompt*,
     - by providing them as *CLI arguments* in your interactive shell or in
       *scripts*,
     - or by listing them in an *rc file*.
   - *Themes* with 16 and 256 colors
   - *Complete built-in documentation* with ~help~ command
   - Full *API abstraction layer* makes it possible to support other torrent
     clients (probably deluge, maybe rtorrent)

** Examples
   Add two torrents (file and hash) and exit
   #+BEGIN_SRC sh
   $ stig add /path/to/some.torrent d4d6b73851fe3288e40389a8e1fb98124a9b9ba5
   #+END_SRC

   Connect to non-default host and present the TUI
   #+BEGIN_SRC sh
   $ stig set srv.url torrents.local:1234
   #+END_SRC

   Print all uploading and/or downloading torrents on torrents.local and exit
   #+BEGIN_SRC sh
   $ stig set srv.url torrents.local \; ls active
   #+END_SRC

   List torrents with more than 50 seeds, then remove them
   #+BEGIN_SRC sh
   $ stig ls 'seeds>50'
   $ stig rm 'seeds>50'
   #+END_SRC

   Stop/pause torrents with ~/foo/~ in their download path and a ratio above 10
   #+BEGIN_SRC sh
   $ stig stop 'path~/foo/&ratio>10'
   #+END_SRC

   Open two tabs with different torrent lists:
     - slowly uploading torrents with ~/foo/~ in their download path
     - small or well-seeded torrents, sorted by size (ascending) and number of
       seeds (descending)
   #+BEGIN_SRC sh
   $ stig tab ls 'path~/foo/&rate-up<10k' \; tab ls 'size<500M|seeds>=1k' --sort 'size,!seeds'
   #+END_SRC

** Configuration
   All configuration is done in ~$HOME/.config/stig/rc~.  Each line is a command
   that is called during startup.  Commands given as CLI arguments are called
   after the rc commands.  For more information run ~stig help rcfile~.

*** Example config
   #+BEGIN_SRC
   # Host that runs Transmission daemon
   set srv.url otherhost:123

   # Poll every 10 seconds
   set tui.poll 10

   # Default columns in torrent lists
   set tlist.columns name ratio rate-up rate-down

   # Open a few tabs
   tab ls active --sort !progress,path,!rate
   tab ls paused --sort !progress --columns name,progress,ratio,size
   tab ls isolated --sort tracker --columns name,path
   #+END_SRC
